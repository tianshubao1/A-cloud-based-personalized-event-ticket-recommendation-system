Cloud Computing Course Project
In this paper, we presented a cloud-based event recommendation system for event search based on geo-location. The model is able to predict and recommend events to users
based on content category and user behaviors. Typical functions of the models includes search API, POST servlet, GET servlet and authentication APIs. Meanwhile, various recommendation
algorithm can be explored in order to provide an ubiquitous suggestion for users. Also, the model is deployed on AWS EC2 virtual machine which can handle 150 queries simultaneously
per second tested by Apache JMeter.
